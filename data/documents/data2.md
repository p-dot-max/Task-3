The **history of artificial intelligence** (**AI**) began in [antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history "Ancient history"), with myths, stories, and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the [programmable digital computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an [electronic brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_brain "Electronic brain").

The field of AI research was founded at a [workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop "Dartmouth workshop") held on the campus of [Dartmouth College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College "Dartmouth College") in 1956.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKaplanHaenlein2018-1) Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The [U.S. government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA") provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994143%E2%80%93156-2)

Eventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994144%E2%80%93152-3) In 1974, criticism from [James Lighthill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lighthill "James Lighthill") and pressure from the U.S. Congress led the U.S. and [British Governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Governments "British Governments") to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the [Japanese Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Government "Japanese Government") and the success of [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system "Expert system") reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise. However, investors' enthusiasm waned in the 1990s, and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry (a period known as an "[AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter "AI winter")"). Nevertheless, research and funding continued to grow under other names.

In the early 2000s, [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets, and the application of solid mathematical methods. Soon after, [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning "Deep learning") proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The [transformer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture) "Transformer (deep learning architecture)") debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI "Generative AI") applications, amongst other use cases.

Investment in AI [boomed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom "AI boom") in the 2020s. The recent AI boom, initiated by the development of transformer architecture, led to the rapid scaling and public releases of [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_models "Large language models") (LLMs) like [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT "ChatGPT"). These models exhibit human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity, and have been integrated into various sectors, fueling exponential investment in AI. However, concerns about the potential risks and [ethical implications of advanced AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence "Ethics of artificial intelligence") have also emerged, causing debate about the future of AI and its impact on society.

### Myth, folklore, and fiction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Myth, folklore, and fiction")]

Mythology and folklore has depictions of [automatons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") and similar human-like artificial life.

In [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), [Talos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos "Talos") was a creature made of bronze who acted as a guardian for the [island of Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete "Crete").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhodios2007Book_4,_the_Talos_episode-4)

Alchemists in the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age"), such as [Jabir ibn Hayyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabir_ibn_Hayyan "Jabir ibn Hayyan"), attempted _[Takwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takwin "Takwin")_, the artificial creation of life, including human life, although this may have been metaphorical.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Connor1994-5)

In Jewish folklore during the Middle Ages, a [Golem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem "Golem") was a clay sculpture that was said to have come to life through the insertion of a piece of paper with any of God's names on it into the mouth.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJewish_EncyclopediaGOLEM-6) 16th century Swiss alchemist [Paracelsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus "Paracelsus") described a procedure he claimed would fabricate a [homunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus "Homunculus"), or artificial man.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinden2003-7)[Brazen heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_head "Brazen head") were a recurring motif in late medieval and early modern folklore.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist199438-8)

By the 19th century, ideas about artificial men and thinking machines became a popular theme in fiction. Notable works like [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley "Mary Shelley")'s _[Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein "Frankenstein")_ , [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe")'s, _[Faust, Part Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust,\_Part\_Two "Faust, Part Two")_, and [Karel Čapek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek "Karel Čapek")'s _[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R.\_(Rossum%27s\_Universal\_Robots) "R.U.R.

Artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. Philosophers had developed structured methods of formal deduction by the first millennium BCE.

Spanish philosopher [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull "Ramon Llull") (1232–1315) developed several _logical machines_ devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means;[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarreras_y_Artau2018-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig20216-28) Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations, produced by the machine by mechanical meanings, in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBonner2007-29) Llull's work had a great influence on [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"), who redeveloped his ideas.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBonner198557%E2%80%9371-30)

[Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"), who speculated that human reason could be reduced to mechanical calculation

In the 17th century, [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"), [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes") and [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-31) Hobbes wrote in _[Leviathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan\_(Hobbes\_book) "Leviathan (Hobbes book)")_: "For _reason_ ... is nothing but _reckoning_, that is adding and subtracting".[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-32) Leibniz described a universal language of reasoning, the _[characteristica universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica\_universalis "Characteristica universalis")_, which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that "there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand, down to their slates, and to say to each other (with a friend as witness, if they liked): _Let us calculate_."[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-33)

The study of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), such as [Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole "George Boole")'s _[The Laws of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Laws\_of\_Thought "The Laws of Thought")_ and [Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frege "Frege")'s _[Begriffsschrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begriffsschrift "Begriffsschrift")_, have allowed for the scientific study of artificial intelligence.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig20218-34) Building on Frege's system, [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") and [Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead") presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in the _[Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia\_Mathematica "Principia Mathematica")_ in 1913.

[Donald Hebb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Hebb "Donald Hebb") was a Canadian psychologist whose work laid the foundation for modern neuroscience, particularly in understanding learning, memory, and neural plasticity. His most influential book, _The Organization of Behavior_ (1949), introduced the concept of Hebbian learning, often summarized as "cells that fire together wire together."[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-41)

Hebb began formulating the foundational ideas for this book in the early 1940s, particularly during his time at the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology from 1942 to 1947. He made extensive notes between June 1944 and March 1945 and sent a complete draft to his mentor Karl Lashley in 1946. The manuscript for _The Organization of Behavior_ wasn't published until 1949. The delay was due to various factors, including World War II and shifts in academic focus. By the time it was published, several of his peers had already published related ideas, making Hebb's work seem less groundbreaking at first glance. However, his synthesis of psychological and neurophysiological principles became a cornerstone of neuroscience and machine learning.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-42)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-43)

The [IBM 702](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_702 "IBM 702"): a computer used by the first generation of AI researchers.

The earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Recent research in [neurology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology "Neurology") had shown that the brain was an electrical network of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener "Norbert Wiener")'s [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic "Cybernetic") described control and stability in electrical networks. [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon")'s [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory") described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing "Alan Turing")'s [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation") showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an "electronic brain".

In the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) explored several research directions that would be vital to later AI research.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-54) Alan Turing was among the first people to seriously investigate the theoretical possibility of "machine intelligence".[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECopeland2004-55) The field of "[artificial intelligence research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence")" was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Dartmouth_workshop-56)

In 1950, Turing published a landmark paper, "[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence "Computing Machinery and Intelligence")", in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-58)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-59) In the paper, he noted that "thinking" is difficult to define and devised his famous [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Test "Turing Test"): If a machine could carry on a conversation (over a [teleprinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter "Teleprinter")) that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was "thinking".[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist199492%E2%80%9398-60) This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a "thinking machine" was at least _plausible_ and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021981-61) The Turing test was the first serious proposal in the [philosophy of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence "Philosophy of artificial intelligence").

[Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts "Walter Pitts") and [Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch "Warren Sturgis McCulloch") analyzed networks of idealized [artificial neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron "Artificial neuron") and showed how they might perform simple logical functions in 1943. They were the first to describe what later researchers would call a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-62) The paper was influenced by Turing's paper "[On Computable Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof "Turing's proof")" from 1936, using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECopeland2004-55) One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") who was a 24-year-old graduate student at the time. In 1951, Minsky and Dean Edmonds built the first neural net machine, the [SNARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_Neural_Analog_Reinforcement_Calculator "Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-63) Minsky would later become one of the most important leaders and innovators in Artificial Intelligence.

Experimental robots such as [William Grey Walter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Grey_Walter "William Grey Walter")'s [turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot) "Turtle (robot)") and the [Johns Hopkins Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Beast "Johns Hopkins Beast"), were built in the 1950s. These machines did not use computers, digital electronics, or symbolic reasoning; they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-64)

In 1951, using the [Ferranti Mark 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1 "Ferranti Mark 1") machine of the [University of Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester "University of Manchester"), [Christopher Strachey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Strachey "Christopher Strachey") wrote a checkers program[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202117-65) and [Dietrich Prinz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Prinz "Dietrich Prinz") wrote one for chess.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECopeland1999-66)[Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist) "Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)")'s checkers program, the subject of his 1959 paper "Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers", eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchaeffer1997Chapter_6-67) Samuel's program was among the first uses of what would later be called [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning").[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202117,_19-68)[Game AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_AI "Game AI") would continue to be used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history.

When access to [digital computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_computer "Digital computer") became possible in the mid-fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought. This was a new approach to creating thinking machines.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004137%E2%80%93170-69)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199344%E2%80%9347-70)

In 1955, [Allen Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and future Nobel Laureate [Herbert A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon "Herbert A. Simon") created the "Logic Theorist", with help from [J. C. Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Shaw "Cliff Shaw"). The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") and [Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead")'s _[Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia\_Mathematica "Principia Mathematica")_, and find new and more elegant proofs for some.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-71) Simon said that they had "solved the venerable [mind/body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind/body_problem "Mind/body problem"), explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind."[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-72)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-73) The symbolic reasoning paradigm they introduced would dominate AI research and funding until the mid-90s, as well as inspire the [cognitive revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution "Cognitive revolution").

The Dartmouth workshop of 1956 was a pivotal event that marked the formal inception of AI as an academic discipline.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Dartmouth_workshop-56) It was organized by [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") and [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist) "John McCarthy (computer scientist)"), with the support of two senior scientists [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") and [Nathan Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Rochester_(computer_scientist) "Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)") of [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM"). The proposal for the conference stated they intended to test the assertion that "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCarthyMinskyRochesterShannon1955-74)[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-77) The term "Artificial Intelligence" was introduced by John McCarthy at the workshop.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-81) The participants included [Ray Solomonoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Solomonoff "Ray Solomonoff"), [Oliver Selfridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Selfridge "Oliver Selfridge"), [Trenchard More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenchard_More "Trenchard More"), [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist) "Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)"), [Allen Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Herbert A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon "Herbert A. Simon"), all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of AI research.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004129%E2%80%93130-82)[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-83) At the workshop, Newell and Simon debuted the "Logic Theorist".[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004125-84) The workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first major success and its key players, and is widely considered the birth of AI.[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-86)

### Cognitive revolution

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Cognitive revolution")]

In the autumn of 1956, Newell and Simon also presented the Logic Theorist at a meeting of the Special Interest Group in Information Theory at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") (MIT). At the same meeting, [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky") discussed his [generative grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar "Generative grammar"), and [George Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller "George Armitage Miller") described his landmark paper "[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two")". Miller wrote "I left the symposium with a conviction, more intuitive than rational, that experimental psychology, theoretical linguistics, and the computer simulation of cognitive processes were all pieces from a larger whole."[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller2003-87)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202114-52)

This meeting was the beginning of the "[cognitive revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution "Cognitive revolution")"—an interdisciplinary [paradigm shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift "Paradigm shift") in psychology, philosophy, computer science and neuroscience. It inspired the creation of the sub-fields of [symbolic artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence "Symbolic artificial intelligence"), [generative linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_linguistics "Generative linguistics"), [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science"), [cognitive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology"), [cognitive neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience "Cognitive neuroscience") and the philosophical schools of [computationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computationalism "Computationalism") and [functionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy) "Functionalism (philosophy)"). All these fields used related tools to model the mind and results discovered in one field were relevant to the others.

The cognitive approach allowed researchers to consider "mental objects" like thoughts, plans, goals, facts or memories, often analyzed using [high level symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system "Physical symbol system") in functional networks. These objects had been forbidden as "unobservable" by earlier paradigms such as [behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism "Behaviorism").[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-89) Symbolic mental objects would become the major focus of AI research and funding for the next several decades.

Early successes (1956–1974)
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Early successes (1956–1974)")]

The programs developed in the years after the [Dartmouth Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop "Dartmouth workshop") were, to most people, simply "astonishing":[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-92) computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such "intelligent" behavior by machines was possible at all.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199352%E2%80%93107-93)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoravec19889-94)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202118-91) Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-95) Government agencies like the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency") (DARPA, then known as "ARPA") poured money into the field.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-96) Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at many British and US universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECopeland2004-55)

[Stanisław Lem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem "Stanisław Lem")'s philosophical essay on "intellectronics" appeared in Lem's _[Summa Technologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa\_Technologiae "Summa Technologiae")_ in 1964.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-97)

There were many successful programs and new directions in the late 50s and 1960s. Some of the most influential included:

#### Reasoning, planning and problem solving as search

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Reasoning, planning and problem solving as search")]

Many early AI programs used the same basic [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm"). To achieve some goal (like winning a game or proving a theorem), they proceeded step by step towards it (by making a move or a deduction) as if searching through a maze, [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking "Backtracking") whenever they reached a dead end.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-98) The principal difficulty was that, for many problems, the number of possible paths through the "maze" was astronomical (a situation known as a "[combinatorial explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion "Combinatorial explosion")"). Researchers would reduce the search space by using [heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics "Heuristics") that would eliminate paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004246-99)

[Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon "Herbert A. Simon") tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the "[General Problem Solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver "General Problem Solver")".[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004245%E2%80%93250-100)[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202119,_106-101) Other "searching" programs accomplished impressive results like solving problems in geometry and algebra, such as [Herbert Gelernter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Gelernter "Herbert Gelernter")'s Geometry Theorem Prover (1958)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202119-102) and Symbolic Automatic Integrator (SAINT), written by [Minsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") student James Slagle in 1961.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199351%E2%80%9358,_65%E2%80%9366-103)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202120-104) Other programs searched through goals and subgoals to [plan actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Automatic_scheduling_and_planning&action=edit&redlink=1 "Automatic scheduling and planning (page does not exist)"), like the [STRIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Research_Institute_Problem_Solver "Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver") system developed at [Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford "Stanford") to control the behavior of the robot [Shakey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakey_the_Robot "Shakey the Robot").[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-105)

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Semantic_Net.svg)

An example of a [semantic network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network "Semantic network")

An important goal of AI research is to allow computers to communicate in [natural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing") like English. An early success was [Daniel Bobrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bobrow "Daniel Bobrow")'s program [STUDENT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUDENT_(computer_program) "STUDENT (computer program)"), which could solve high-school algebra word-problems.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-106)

A [semantic net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_net "Semantic net") represents concepts (e.g., "house", "door") as nodes, and relations among concepts as links between the nodes (e.g. "has-a"). Ross Quillian wrote the first AI program to use a semantic net,[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199379%E2%80%9383-107) and the most successful (and controversial) version was [Roger Schank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank "Roger Schank")'s [Conceptual dependency theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_dependency_theory "Conceptual dependency theory").[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993164%E2%80%93172-108)

[Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum "Joseph Weizenbaum")'s [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA "ELIZA") could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not with a computer program (see [ELIZA effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect "ELIZA effect")). But in fact, ELIZA simply gave a [canned response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canned_response "Canned response") or repeated back what was said to it, rephrasing its response with a few grammar-rules. ELIZA was the first [chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot "Chatbot").[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004291%E2%80%93296-109)[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993134%E2%80%93139-110)

In the late 60s, [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") and [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert "Seymour Papert") of the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT") AI Laboratory proposed that AI research should focus on artificially simple situations known as micro-worlds.[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-111) They pointed out that in successful sciences like physics, basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies. Much of the research focused on a "[blocks world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_world "Blocks world")", which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Blocks_world-112)

This paradigm led to innovative work in [machine vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_vision "Machine vision") by [Gerald Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Sussman "Gerald Sussman"), Adolfo Guzman, [David Waltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Waltz "David Waltz") (who invented "[constraint propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_propagation "Constraint propagation")"), and especially [Patrick Winston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston "Patrick Winston"). At the same time, Minsky and Papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks, bringing the blocks world to life. [Terry Winograd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Winograd "Terry Winograd")'s [SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU "SHRDLU") could communicate in ordinary English sentences about the micro-world, plan operations and execute them.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Blocks_world-112)

#### Perceptrons and early neural networks

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Perceptrons and early neural networks")]

In the 1960s, research-funders primarily supported laboratories researching [symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence "Symbolic artificial intelligence"), however, several people still pursued research in neural networks.

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:330-PSA-80-60_(USN_710739)_(20897323365).jpg)

[The Mark 1 Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_Perceptron "Mark I Perceptron")

The [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron "Perceptron"), a single-layer [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network") was introduced in 1958 by [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt "Frank Rosenblatt")[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-113) (who had been a schoolmate of [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") at the [Bronx High School of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science "Bronx High School of Science")).[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993102-114) Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that a perceptron "may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages".[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-115) Rosenblatt was primarily funded by the [Office of Naval Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Research "Office of Naval Research").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERosenblatt1962-116)

[Bernard Widrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Widrow "Bernard Widrow") and his student [Ted Hoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcian_Hoff "Marcian Hoff") built [ADALINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE "ADALINE") (1960) and [MADALINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE "ADALINE") (1962), which had up to 1000 adjustable weights.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202120%E2%80%9321-117)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWidrowLehr1990-118) A group at [Stanford Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International "SRI International") led by [Charles A. Rosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Rosen_(scientist) "Charles Rosen (scientist)") and Alfred E. (Ted) Brain built two neural-network machines named MINOS I (1960) and II (1963), mainly funded by the [U.S. Army Signal Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Signal_Corps "United States Army Signal Corps"). MINOS II[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERosenNilssonAdams1965-119) had 6600 adjustable weights,[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENilsson1984-120) and was controlled with an [SDS 910 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDS_9_Series "SDS 9 Series") in a configuration named MINOS III (1968), which could classify symbols on army maps, and recognize hand-printed characters on [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran "Fortran")[coding sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era "Computer programming in the punched card era").[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHartNilssonPerraultMitchell2003-121)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielson2005-122) Most of neural-network research during this early period involved building and using bespoke hardware, rather than simulation on digital computers.[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-124)

However, partly due to lack of results and partly due to competition from [symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_AI "Symbolic AI") research, the MINOS project ran out of funding in 1966. Rosenblatt failed to secure continued funding in the 1960s.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlazaran_Rodriguez1991-123) In 1969, research came to a sudden halt with the publication of [Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") and [Papert's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert "Seymour Papert") 1969 book [_Perceptrons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book) "Perceptrons (book)").[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMinskyPapert1969-125) It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Rosenblatt's predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was that virtually no research was funded in [connectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism "Connectionism") for 10 years.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202122-126) The competition for government funding ended with the victory of symbolic AI approaches over neural networks.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielson2005-122)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlazaran_Rodriguez1991-123)

Minsky (who had worked on [SNARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_Neural_Analog_Reinforcement_Calculator "Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator")) became a staunch objector to pure connectionist AI. [Widrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Widrow "Bernard Widrow") (who had worked on [ADALINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE "ADALINE")) turned to adaptive signal processing. The [SRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International "SRI International") group (which worked on MINOS) turned to symbolic AI and robotics.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENielson2005-122)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlazaran_Rodriguez1991-123)

The main problem was the inability to train multilayered networks (versions of [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation "Backpropagation") had already been used in other fields, but it was unknown to these researchers).[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchmidhuber2022-127)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202122-126) The AI community became aware of backpropagation in the 1980s,[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-128) and, in the 21st century, neural networks would become enormously successful, fulfilling all of Rosenblatt's optimistic predictions. Rosenblatt did not live to see this, however, as he died in a boating accident in 1971.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993105-129)

The first generation of AI researchers made the following predictions about their work:

*   1958, [H. A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._A._Simon "H. A. Simon") and [Allen Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell"): "within ten years a digital computer will be the world's chess champion" and "within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem."[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-130)
*   1965, H. A. Simon: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do."[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-131)
*   1967, [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky"): "Within a generation... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved."[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-132)
*   1970, Marvin Minsky (in [_Life_ magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_magazine "Life magazine")): "In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being."[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDarrach1970-133)[[l]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-136)

In June 1963, [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT") received a $2.2 million grant from the newly formed Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later known as [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA")). The money was used to fund [project MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MAC "Project MAC") which subsumed the "AI Group" founded by [Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") and [McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist) "John McCarthy (computer scientist)") five years earlier. DARPA continued to provide $3 million each year until the 1970s.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199364%E2%80%9365-137) DARPA made similar grants to [Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon "Herbert A. Simon") program at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University") and to [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University")'s [AI Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_AI_Lab "Stanford AI Lab"), founded by [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist) "John McCarthy (computer scientist)") in 1963.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199394-138) Another important AI laboratory was established at [Edinburgh University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_University "Edinburgh University") by [Donald Michie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Michie "Donald Michie") in 1965.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHowe1994-139) These four institutions would continue to be the main centers of AI research and funding in academia for many years.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199351-140)[[m]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-142)

The money was given with few strings attached: [J. C. R. Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider "J. C. R. Licklider"), then the director of ARPA, believed that his organization should "fund people, not projects!" and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier199365-143) This created a freewheeling atmosphere at MIT that gave birth to the [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture "Hacker culture"),[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-144) but this "hands off" approach did not last.

First AI winter (1974–1980)
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: First AI winter (1974–1980)")]

In the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised public expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding targeted at AI was severely reduced.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993163%E2%80%93196-145) The lack of success indicated that the techniques being used by AI researchers at the time were insufficient to achieve their goals.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDreyfus1972-146)[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELighthill1973-147)

These setbacks did not affect the growth and progress of the field, however. The funding cuts only impacted a handful of major laboratories[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaigh2023-148) and the critiques were largely ignored.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993143-149) General public interest in the field continued to grow,[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaigh2023-148) the number of researchers increased dramatically,[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaigh2023-148) and new ideas were explored in [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming "Logic programming"), [commonsense reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning "Commonsense reasoning") and many other areas. Historian Thomas Haigh argued in 2023 that there was no winter,[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaigh2023-148) and AI researcher [Nils Nilsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_John_Nilsson "Nils John Nilsson") described this period as the most "exciting" time to work in AI.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENilsson20091-150)

In the early seventies, the capabilities of AI programs were limited. Even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve;[[n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-152) all the programs were, in some sense, "toys".[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993146-153) AI researchers had begun to run into several limits that would be only conquered decades later, and others that still stymie the field in the 2020s:

*   **[Limited computer power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law")**: There was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful.[[o]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-155) For example: Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only 20 words, because that was all that would fit in memory.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993146%E2%80%93148-156)[Hans Moravec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec "Hans Moravec") argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require [horsepower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower "Horsepower"). Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power [increases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law"), eventually it could become easy. "With enough horsepower," he wrote, "anything will fly".[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoravec1976-157)[[p]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-159)
*   **[Intractability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intractability_(complexity) "Intractability (complexity)") and the [combinatorial explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion "Combinatorial explosion")**: In 1972 [Richard Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Karp "Richard Karp") (building on [Stephen Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cook "Stephen Cook")'s 1971 [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%27s_theorem "Cook's theorem")) showed there are [many problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems "Karp's 21 NP-complete problems") that can only be solved in [exponential time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time "Exponential time"). Finding optimal solutions to these problems requires extraordinary amounts of computer time, except when the problems are trivial. This limitation applied to all symbolic AI programs that used search trees and meant that many of the "toy" solutions used by AI would never scale to useful systems.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202121-151)[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELighthill1973-147)
*   **[Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox "Moravec's paradox")**: Early AI research had been very successful at getting computers to do "intelligent" tasks like proving theorems, solving geometry problems and playing chess. Their success at these intelligent tasks convinced them that the problem of intelligent behavior had been largely solved.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004456-160)[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooks2002-161) However, they utterly failed to make progress on "unintelligent" tasks like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004456-160)[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoravec198815%E2%80%9316-162) By the 1980s, researchers would realize that symbolic reasoning was utterly unsuited for these perceptual and sensorimotor tasks and that there were limits to this approach.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooks2002-161)
*   **The breadth of [commonsense knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_knowledge "Commonsense knowledge")**: Many important artificial intelligence applications like [vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") or [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") require enormous amounts of information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a vast amount of information with billions of atomic facts. No one in 1970 could build a database large enough and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-163)
*   **Representing [commonsense reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning "Commonsense reasoning")**: Several related problems[[q]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-164) appeared when researchers tried to represent commonsense reasoning using formal logic or symbols. Descriptions of very ordinary deductions tended to get longer and longer the more one worked on them, as more and more exceptions, clarifications and distinctions were required. [[r]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-165) However, when people thought about ordinary concepts, they did not rely on precise definitions, rather they seemed to make hundreds of imprecise assumptions, correcting them when necessary using their entire body of commonsense knowledge. [Gerald Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Sussman "Gerald Sussman") observed that "using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise."[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-166)

### Decrease in funding

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Decrease in funding")]

The agencies that funded AI research, such as the [British government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_government "British government"), [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA") and the [National Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council "United States National Research Council") (NRC) became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected AI research. The pattern began in 1966 when the [Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Language_Processing_Advisory_Committee "Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee") (ALPAC) report criticized machine translation efforts. After spending $20 million, the [NRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council "United States National Research Council") ended all support.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-167) In 1973, the [Lighthill report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthill_report "Lighthill report") on the state of AI research in the UK criticized the failure of AI to achieve its "grandiose objectives" and led to the dismantling of AI research in that country.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-168) (The report specifically mentioned the [combinatorial explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion "Combinatorial explosion") problem as a reason for AI's failings.)[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELighthill1973-147)[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202121-151)[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-170) DARPA was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the [Speech Understanding Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition") program at CMU and canceled an annual grant of $3 million.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993115%E2%80%93116-171)[[t]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-172)

[Hans Moravec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec "Hans Moravec") blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues. "Many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration."[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993115-173)[[u]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-174) However, there was another issue: since the passage of the [Mansfield Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield_Amendment "Mansfield Amendment") in 1969, [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA") had been under increasing pressure to fund "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA, which instead directed money at specific projects with clear objectives, such as [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous "Autonomous") tanks and [battle management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_management "Battle management") systems.[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENRC1999under_%22Shift_to_Applied_Research_Increases_Investment.%22-175)[[v]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-177)

The major laboratories (MIT, Stanford, CMU and Edinburgh) had been receiving generous support from their governments, and when it was withdrawn, these were the only places that were seriously impacted by the budget cuts. The thousands of researchers outside these institutions and the many thousands that were joining the field were unaffected.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaigh2023-148)

### Philosophical and ethical critiques

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Philosophical and ethical critiques")]

Several philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was [John Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lucas_(philosopher) "John Lucas (philosopher)"), who argued that [Gödel's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem "Gödel's incompleteness theorem") showed that a [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") (such as a computer program) could never see the truth of certain statements, while a human being could.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-178)[Hubert Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus "Hubert Dreyfus") ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little "symbol processing" and a great deal of [embodied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition "Embodied cognition"), [instinctive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct "Instinct"), unconscious "[know how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready-to-hand "Ready-to-hand")".[[w]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-180)[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-181)[John Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle "John Searle")'s [Chinese Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Room "Chinese Room") argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to "understand" the symbols that it uses (a quality called "[intentionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentionality "Intentionality")"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as "thinking".[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-182)

These critiques were not taken seriously by AI researchers. Problems like [intractability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intractability_(complexity) "Intractability (complexity)") and [commonsense knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning "Commonsense reasoning") seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference "[know how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready-to-hand "Ready-to-hand")" or "[intentionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentionality "Intentionality")" made to an actual computer program. MIT's [Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") said of Dreyfus and Searle, "they misunderstand, and should be ignored."[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-183) Dreyfus, who also taught at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT"), was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers "dared not be seen having lunch with me."[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-184)[Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum "Joseph Weizenbaum"), the author of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA "ELIZA"), was also an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, but he "deliberately made it plain that [his AI colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus] was not the way to treat a human being,"[[x]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-186) and was unprofessional and childish.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994276-187)

Weizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about AI when [Kenneth Colby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Colby "Kenneth Colby") wrote a "computer program which can conduct [psychotherapeutic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapeutic "Psychotherapeutic") dialogue" based on ELIZA.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEColbyWattGilbert1966148-188)[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeizenbaum19765,_6-189)[[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-191) Weizenbaum was disturbed that Colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, [Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum "Joseph Weizenbaum") published _[Computer Power and Human Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_Power\_and\_Human\_Reason "Computer Power and Human Reason")_ which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-192)

### Logic at Stanford, CMU, and Edinburgh

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Logic at Stanford, CMU, and Edinburgh")]

Logic was introduced into AI research as early as 1958, by [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist) "John McCarthy (computer scientist)") in his [Advice Taker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_Taker "Advice Taker") proposal.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck200451-193)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202119-102) In 1963, [J. Alan Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Alan_Robinson "J. Alan Robinson") had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic) "Resolution (logic)") and [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computing) "Unification (computing)") algorithms.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202119-102) However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 1960s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck200451-193)[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993190%E2%80%93192-194) A more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the 1970s by [Robert Kowalski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kowalski "Robert Kowalski") at the [University of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh "University of Edinburgh"), and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers [Alain Colmerauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Colmerauer "Alain Colmerauer") and [Philippe Roussel](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philippe_Roussel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philippe Roussel (page does not exist)")[[fr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Roussel "fr:Philippe Roussel")] who created the successful logic programming language [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog").[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993193%E2%80%93196-195) Prolog uses a subset of logic ([Horn clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause "Horn clause"), closely related to "[rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system "Rule-based system")" and "[production rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_system_(computer_science) "Production system (computer science)")") that permits tractable computation. Rules would continue to be influential, providing a foundation for [Edward Feigenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Feigenbaum "Edward Feigenbaum")'s [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_systems "Expert systems") and the continuing work by [Allen Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Herbert A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon "Herbert A. Simon") that would lead to [Soar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soar_(cognitive_architecture) "Soar (cognitive architecture)") and their [unified theories of cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_theories_of_cognition "Unified theories of cognition").[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993145%E2%80%93149,_258%E2%80%9363-196)

Critics of the logical approach noted, as [Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus "Hubert Dreyfus") had, that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems. Experiments by psychologists like [Peter Wason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cathcart_Wason "Peter Cathcart Wason"), [Eleanor Rosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rosch "Eleanor Rosch"), [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky "Amos Tversky"), [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman "Daniel Kahneman") and others provided proof.[[z]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-197) McCarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant. He argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.[[aa]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-198)

### MIT's "anti-logic" approach

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: MIT's \"anti-logic\" approach")]

Among the critics of [McCarthy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist) "John McCarthy (computer scientist)") approach were his colleagues across the country at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT"). [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky"), [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert "Seymour Papert") and [Roger Schank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank "Roger Schank") were trying to solve problems like "story understanding" and "object recognition" that _required_ a machine to think like a person. To use ordinary concepts like "chair" or "restaurant" they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. MIT chose instead to focus on writing programs that solved a given task without using high-level abstract definitions or general theories of cognition, and measured performance by iterative testing, rather than arguments from first principles. [Schank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank "Roger Schank") described their "anti-logic" approaches as [_scruffy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neats_vs._scruffies "Neats vs. scruffies"), as opposed to the [_neat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neats_vs._scruffies "Neats vs. scruffies") paradigm used by [McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist) "John McCarthy (computer scientist)"), [Kowalski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kowalski "Robert Kowalski"), [Feigenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Feigenbaum "Edward Feigenbaum"), [Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon "Herbert A. Simon").[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-199)[[ab]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-200)

In 1975, in a seminal paper, [Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") noted that many of his fellow researchers were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our [common sense assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_knowledge "Commonsense knowledge") about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on (none of which are true for all birds). Minsky associated these assumptions with the general category and they could be _[inherited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance\_(object-oriented\_programming) "Inheritance (object-oriented programming)")_ by the frames for subcategories and individuals, or over-ridden as necessary. He called these structures _[frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame\_(Artificial\_intelligence) "Frame (Artificial intelligence)")_. [Schank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank "Roger Schank") used a version of frames he called "[scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripts_(artificial_intelligence) "Scripts (artificial intelligence)")" to successfully answer questions about short stories in English.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-201) Frames would eventually be widely used in [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering") under the name [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming").

The logicians rose to the challenge. [Pat Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Hayes "Pat Hayes") claimed that "most of 'frames' is just a new syntax for parts of first-order logic." But he noted that "there are one or two apparently minor details which give a lot of trouble, however, especially defaults".[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHayes1981-202)

[Ray Reiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Reiter "Raymond Reiter") admitted that "conventional logics, such as first-order logic, lack the expressive power to adequately represent the knowledge required for reasoning by default".[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReiter1978-203) He proposed augmenting first-order logic with a [closed world assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_world_assumption "Closed world assumption") that a conclusion holds (by default) if its contrary cannot be shown. He showed how such an assumption corresponds to the common-sense assumption made in reasoning with frames. He also showed that it has its "procedural equivalent" as [negation as failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation_as_failure "Negation as failure") in [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog"). The closed world assumption, as formulated by Reiter, "is not a first-order notion. (It is a meta notion.)"[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReiter1978-203) However, [Keith Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Clark_(computer_scientist) "Keith Clark (computer scientist)") showed that negation as _finite failure_ can be understood as reasoning implicitly with definitions in first-order logic including a [unique name assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_name_assumption "Unique name assumption") that different terms denote different individuals.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark1977-204)

During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, a variety of logics and extensions of first-order logic were developed both for negation as failure in [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming "Logic programming") and for default reasoning more generally. Collectively, these logics have become known as [non-monotonic logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-monotonic_logic "Non-monotonic logic").

In the 1980s, a form of AI program called "[expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system "Expert system")" was adopted by corporations around the world and [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation "Knowledge representation") became the focus of mainstream AI research. Governments provided substantial funding, such as Japan's [fifth generation computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer "Fifth generation computer") project and the U.S. [Strategic Computing Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Computing_Initiative "Strategic Computing Initiative"). "Overall, the AI industry boomed from a few million dollars in 1980 to billions of dollars in 1988."[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-128)

### Expert systems become widely used

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Expert systems become widely used")]

An [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system "Expert system") is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_system_(computer_science) "Production system (computer science)") that are derived from the knowledge of experts.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-205) The earliest examples were developed by [Edward Feigenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Feigenbaum "Edward Feigenbaum") and his students. [Dendral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendral "Dendral"), begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004327%E2%80%93335-206)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202122-126)[MYCIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MYCIN "MYCIN"), developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-128) They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.

Expert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the [commonsense knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_knowledge "Commonsense knowledge") problem)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202122-126) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be _useful_: something that AI had not been able to achieve up to this point.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993158%E2%80%93159-207)

In 1980, an expert system called [R1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R1_(expert_system) "R1 (expert system)") was completed at [CMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University") for the [Digital Equipment Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation"). It was an enormous success: it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986.[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993198-208) Corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985, they were spending over a billion dollars on AI, most of it in in-house AI departments.[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994259-209) An industry grew up to support them, including hardware companies like [Symbolics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics "Symbolics") and [Lisp Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machines "Lisp Machines") and software companies such as [IntelliCorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliCorp_(Software) "IntelliCorp (Software)") and [Aion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleverpath_AION_Business_Rules_Expert "Cleverpath AION Business Rules Expert").[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-210)

### Government funding increases

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Government funding increases")]

In 1981, the [Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry "Ministry of International Trade and Industry") set aside $850 million for the [Fifth generation computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer "Fifth generation computer") project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-211) Much to the chagrin of [scruffies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neats_vs._scruffies "Neats vs. scruffies"), they initially chose [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog") as the primary computer language for the project.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993195-212)

Other countries responded with new programs of their own. The UK began the £350 million [Alvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvey "Alvey") project.[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202123-213) A consortium of American companies formed the [Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics_and_Computer_Technology_Corporation "Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation") (or "MCC") to fund large-scale projects in AI and information technology.[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993240-214)[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202123-213)[DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA") responded as well, founding the [Strategic Computing Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Computing_Initiative "Strategic Computing Initiative") and tripling its investment in AI between 1984 and 1988.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004426%E2%80%93432-215)[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENRC1999under_%22Shift_to_Applied_Research_Increases_Investment%22-216)

### Knowledge revolution

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Knowledge revolution")]

The power of expert systems came from the expert knowledge they contained. They were part of a new direction in AI research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s. "AI researchers were beginning to suspect—reluctantly, for it violated the scientific canon of [parsimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_parsimony "Principle of parsimony")—that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways,"[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004299-217) writes [Pamela McCorduck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_McCorduck "Pamela McCorduck"). "[T]he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge, sometimes quite detailed knowledge, of a domain where a given task lay".[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004421-218)[Knowledge based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_based_system "Knowledge based system") and [knowledge engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering "Knowledge engineering") became a major focus of AI research in the 1980s.[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-219) It was hoped that vast databases would solve the [commonsense knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_knowledge "Commonsense knowledge") problem and provide the support that [commonsense reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning "Commonsense reasoning") required.

In the 1980s, some researchers attempted to attack the [commonsense knowledge problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning "Commonsense reasoning") directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. [Douglas Lenat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Lenat "Douglas Lenat"), who started a database called [Cyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc "Cyc"), argued that there is no shortcut―the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand.[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-220)

New directions in the 1980s
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: New directions in the 1980s")]

Although symbolic [knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning "Knowledge representation and reasoning") and [logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning "Logical reasoning") produced useful applications in the 80s and received massive amounts of funding, it was still unable to solve problems in [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception"), [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") and [common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense_reasoning "Common sense reasoning"). A small number of scientists and engineers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would ever be sufficient for these tasks and developed other approaches, such as "[connectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism "Connectionism")", ["soft" computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing "Soft computing") and [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning"). [Nils Nilsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_John_Nilsson "Nils John Nilsson") called these approaches "sub-symbolic".

### Revival of neural networks: "connectionism"

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Revival of neural networks: \"connectionism\"")]

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hopfield-net-vector.svg)

A Hopfield net with four nodes

In 1982, physicist [John Hopfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopfield "John Hopfield") was able to prove that a form of neural network (now called a "[Hopfield net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_net "Hopfield net")") could learn and process information, and provably converges after enough time under any fixed condition. It was a breakthrough, as it was previously thought that nonlinear networks would, in general, evolve chaotically.[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESejnowski2018-221)[Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton "Geoffrey Hinton") proved a similar result about a device called a "[Boltzmann machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine "Boltzmann machine")".[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylorMetzMiller2024-222) (Hopfield and Hinton would eventually receive the [2024 Nobel prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics "List of Nobel laureates in Physics") for this work.[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylorMetzMiller2024-222)) In 1986, Hinton and [David Rumelhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rumelhart "David Rumelhart") popularized a method for training neural networks called "[backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation "Backpropagation")".[[ac]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-223) These three developments helped to revive the exploration of [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network").[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-128)[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993214%E2%80%93215-224)

Neural networks, along with several other similar models, received widespread attention after the 1986 publication of the _[Parallel Distributed Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel\_Distributed\_Processing "Parallel Distributed Processing")_, a two-volume collection of papers edited by [Rumelhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rumelhart "David Rumelhart") and psychologist [James McClelland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McClelland_(psychologist) "James McClelland (psychologist)"). The new field was christened "[connectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism "Connectionism")" and there was a considerable debate between advocates of [symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_AI "Symbolic AI") and the "connectionists".[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-128) Hinton called symbols the "[luminous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_aether "Luminous aether") of AI"―that is, an unworkable and misleading model of intelligence.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-128) This was a direct attack on the principles that inspired the [cognitive revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution "Cognitive revolution").

Neural networks started to advance the state of the art in some specialist areas such as protein structure prediction. Following pioneering work from Terry Sejnowski,[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Qian1988-225) cascading multilayer perceptrons such as PhD[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Rost1993-226) and PsiPred[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-McGuffin2000-227) reached near-theoretical maximum accuracy in predicting secondary structure.

In 1990, [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun "Yann LeCun") at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") used [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_networks "Convolutional neural networks") to recognize handwritten digits. The system was used widely in the 90s, reading zip codes and personal checks. This was the first genuinely useful application of neural networks.[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126-228)[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202021%E2%80%9322-229)

### Robotics and embodied reason

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Robotics and embodied reason")]

[Rodney Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks "Rodney Brooks"), [Hans Moravec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec "Hans Moravec") and others argued that, to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a _body_—it needs to perceive, move, survive, and deal with the world.[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004454%E2%80%93462-230) Sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills such as [commonsense reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning "Commonsense reasoning"). They can't be efficiently implemented using abstract symbolic reasoning, so AI should solve the problems of perception, mobility, manipulation and survival without using symbolic representation at all. These robotics researchers advocated building intelligence "from the bottom up".[[ad]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-232)

A precursor to this idea was [David Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_(neuroscientist) "David Marr (neuroscientist)"), who had come to [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT") in the late 1970s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying [vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"). He rejected all symbolic approaches (_both_[McCarthy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist) "John McCarthy (computer scientist)") logic and [Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky")'s frames), arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. (Marr's work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980.)[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrevier1993183%E2%80%93190-233)

In his 1990 paper "Elephants Don't Play Chess",[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooks1990-234) robotics researcher Brooks took direct aim at the [physical symbol system hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system "Physical symbol system"), arguing that symbols are not always necessary since "the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough."[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrooks19903-235)

In the 1980s and 1990s, many [cognitive scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science") also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the "[embodied mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_mind "Embodied mind") thesis".[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-236)

### Soft computing and probabilistic reasoning

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Soft computing and probabilistic reasoning")]

[Soft computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing "Soft computing") uses methods that work with incomplete and imprecise information. They do not attempt to give precise, logical answers, but give results that are only "probably" correct. This allowed them to solve problems that precise symbolic methods could not handle. Press accounts often claimed these tools could "think like a human".[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPollack1984-237)[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPollack1989-238)

[Judea Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl "Judea Pearl")'s _Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference_, an influential 1988 book[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPearl1988-239) brought [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") and [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory") into AI.[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202125-240)[Fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic "Fuzzy logic"), developed by [Lofti Zadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofti_Zadeh "Lofti Zadeh") in the 60s, began to be more widely used in AI and robotics. [Evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation "Evolutionary computation") and [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks "Artificial neural networks") also handle imprecise information, and are classified as "soft". In the 90s and early 2000s many other soft computing tools were developed and put into use, including [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_networks "Bayesian networks"),[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202125-240)[hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_models "Hidden Markov models"),[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202125-240)[information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), and [stochastic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_modeling "Stochastic modeling"). These tools, in turn depended on advanced mathematical techniques such as classical [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(mathematics) "Optimization (mathematics)"). For a time in the 1990s and early 2000s, these soft tools were studied by a subfield of AI called "[computational intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_intelligence "Computational intelligence")".[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPooleMackworthGoebel1998-241)

### Reinforcement learning

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Reinforcement learning")]

[Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning")[[212]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021Section_23-242) rewards an agent every time it performs a desired action well, and may give negative rewards (or "punishments") when it performs poorly. It was described in the first half of the twentieth century by psychologists using animal models, such as [Thorndike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Thorndike "Edward Thorndike"),[[213]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020120%E2%80%93124-243)[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021819-244)[Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov "Ivan Pavlov")[[215]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020124-245) and [Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.F._Skinner "B.F. Skinner").[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020152%E2%80%93156-246) In the 1950s, [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing "Alan Turing")[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021819-244)[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020125-247) and [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist) "Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)")[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021819-244) foresaw the role of reinforcement learning in AI.

A successful and influential research program was led by [Richard Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton "Richard S. Sutton") and [Andrew Barto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Barto "Andrew Barto") beginning in 1972. Their collaboration revolutionized the study of reinforcement learning and decision making over the past four decades.[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020127%E2%80%93129-248)[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202125,_820-249) In 1988, Sutton described machine learning in terms of [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory") (i.e., the [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process "Markov decision process")). This gave the subject a solid theoretical foundation and access to a large body of theoretical results developed in the field of [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research").[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202125,_820-249)

Also in 1988, Sutton and Barto developed the "[temporal difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning "Temporal difference learning")" (TD) learning algorithm, where the agent is rewarded only when its _predictions_ show improvement. It significantly outperformed previous algorithms.[[220]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020140-250) TD-learning was used by Gerald Tesauro in 1992 in the program [TD-Gammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon "TD-Gammon"), which played backgammon as well as the best human players. The program learned the game by playing against itself with zero prior knowledge.[[221]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020141-251) In an interesting case of interdisciplinary convergence, neurologists discovered in 1997 that the [dopamine reward system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system "Reward system") in brains also uses a version of the TD-learning algorithm.[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020?-252)[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021820-253)[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchultzDayanMontague1997-254) TD learning would be become highly influential in the 21st century, used in both [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo "AlphaGo") and [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero "AlphaZero").[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021822-255)

Second AI winter (1990s)
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Second AI winter (1990s)")]

The business community's fascination with AI rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an [economic bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble "Economic bubble"). As dozens of companies failed, the perception in the business world was that the technology was not viable.[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994501,_511-256) The damage to AI's reputation would last into the 21st century. Inside the field, there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure to fulfill the dream of human-level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of "artificial intelligence".[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004424-257)

Over the next 20 years, AI consistently delivered working solutions to specific isolated problems. By the late 1990s, it was being used throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. The success was due to [increasing computer power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law"), by collaboration with other fields (such as [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization "Mathematical optimization") and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics")) and using higher standards of scientific accountability.

The term "[AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter "AI winter")" was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of 1974 when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment would certainly follow.[[ae]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-259) Their fears were well founded: in the late 1980s and early 1990s, AI suffered a series of financial setbacks.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-128)

The first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer "Apple Computer") and [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987, they became more powerful than the more expensive [Lisp machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machines "Lisp machines") made by [Symbolics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics "Symbolics") and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-260)

Eventually, the earliest successful expert systems, such as [XCON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCON "XCON"), proved too expensive to maintain. They were difficult to update, they could not learn, and they were "[brittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittle_(software) "Brittle (software)")" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs). Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts.[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-261)

In the late 1980s, the [Strategic Computing Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Computing_Initiative "Strategic Computing Initiative") cut funding to AI "deeply and brutally". New leadership at [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA") had decided that AI was not "the next wave" and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results.[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004430%E2%80%93431-262)

By 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 for Japan's [Fifth Generation Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer "Fifth generation computer") had not been met. Some of them, like "carry on a casual conversation", would not be accomplished for another 30 years. As with other AI projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-263)[[af]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-265)

Over 300 AI companies had shut down, gone bankrupt, or been acquired by the end of 1993, effectively ending the first commercial wave of AI.[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994440-266) In 1994, [HP Newquist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Newquist "HP Newquist") stated in _The Brain Makers_ that "The immediate future of artificial intelligence—in its commercial form—seems to rest in part on the continued success of neural networks."[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994440-266)

### AI behind the scenes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: AI behind the scenes")]

In the 1990s, algorithms originally developed by AI researchers began to appear as parts of larger systems. AI had solved a lot of very difficult problems[[ag]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-267) and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry,[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENRC1999Artificial_Intelligence_in_the_90s-268)[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKurzweil2005264-269) such as [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining "Data mining"), [industrial robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_robots "Industrial robots"), logistics, [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition"),[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThe_Economist2007-270) banking software,[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECNN2006-271) medical diagnosis,[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECNN2006-271) and [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google")'s search engine.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlsen2004-272)[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlsen2006-273)

The field of AI received little or no credit for these successes in the 1990s and early 2000s. Many of AI's greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science.[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-274)[Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom "Nick Bostrom") explains: "A lot of cutting-edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECNN2006-271)

Many researchers in AI in the 1990s deliberately called their work by other names, such as [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics_(academic_field) "Informatics (academic field)"), [knowledge-based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems "Knowledge-based systems"), "cognitive systems" or [computational intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_intelligence "Computational intelligence"). In part, this may have been because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from AI, but also the new names helped to procure funding.[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThe_Economist2007-270)[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTETascarella2006-275)[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewquist1994532-276) In the commercial world at least, the failed promises of the AI winter continued to haunt AI research into the 2000s, as the _New York Times_ reported in 2005: "Computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers."[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarkoff2005-277)

### Mathematical rigor, greater collaboration, and a narrow focus

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Mathematical rigor, greater collaboration, and a narrow focus")]

AI researchers began to develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past.[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004486%E2%80%93487-278)[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124%E2%80%9325-279) Most of the new directions in AI relied heavily on mathematical models, including [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks "Artificial neural networks"), [probabilistic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_reasoning "Probabilistic reasoning"), [soft computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing "Soft computing") and [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning"). In the 90s and 2000s, many other highly mathematical tools were adapted for AI. These tools were applied to machine learning, perception, and mobility.

There was a widespread realization that many of the problems that AI needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), or [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research"). The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results that were measurable and provable; AI had become a more rigorous "scientific" discipline. Another key reason for the success in the 90s was that AI researchers focused on specific problems with verifiable solutions (an approach later derided as _[narrow AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow\_AI "Narrow AI")_). This provided useful tools in the present, rather than speculation about the future.

A new paradigm called "[intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent "Intelligent agent")" became widely accepted during the 1990s.[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004471%E2%80%93478-280)[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021Chapter_2-281)[[ah]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-283) Although earlier researchers had proposed modular "divide and conquer" approaches to AI,[[ai]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-284) the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until [Judea Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl "Judea Pearl"), [Allen Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell "Allen Newell"), [Leslie P. Kaelbling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_P._Kaelbling "Leslie P. Kaelbling"), and others brought concepts from [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory") and economics into the study of AI.[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202161-282) When the [economist's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") definition of a [rational agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent "Rational agent") was married to [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science")'s definition of an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") or [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(programming) "Module (programming)"), the intelligent agent paradigm was complete.

An [intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent "Intelligent agent") is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are "intelligent agents", as are human beings and organizations of human beings, such as [firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firm "Firm"). The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as "the study of intelligent agents".[[aj]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-285) This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI: it goes beyond studying human intelligence; it studies all kinds of intelligence. The paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and to disagree about methods, but still retain hope that their work could be combined into an [agent architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_architecture "Agent architecture") that would be capable of general intelligence.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004478-286)

### Milestones and Moore's law

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Milestones and Moore's law")]

On 11 May 1997, [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Deep_Blue "IBM Deep Blue") became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, [Garry Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov "Garry Kasparov").[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004480%E2%80%93483-287) In 2005, a Stanford robot won the [DARPA Grand Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge "DARPA Grand Challenge") by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail. Two years later, a team from CMU won the [DARPA Urban Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Urban_Challenge "DARPA Urban Challenge") by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an urban environment while responding to traffic hazards and adhering to traffic laws.[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202128-288)

These successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm, but mostly to the tedious application of engineering skill and to the tremendous increase in the speed and capacity of computers by the 90s.[[ak]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-290) In fact, [Deep Blue's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Deep_Blue "IBM Deep Blue") computer was 10 million times faster than the [Ferranti Mark 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1 "Ferranti Mark 1") that [Christopher Strachey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Strachey "Christopher Strachey") taught to play chess in 1951.[[al]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-291) This dramatic increase is measured by [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law"), which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers double every two years. The fundamental problem of "raw computer power" was slowly being overcome.

### Arts and literature influenced by AI

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: Arts and literature influenced by AI")]

[Electronic literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_literature "Electronic literature") experiments such as _[The Impermanence Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Impermanence\_Agent "The Impermanence Agent")_ (1998–2002) and digital art such as _[Agent Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent\_Ruby "Agent Ruby")_ used AI in their art and literature, "laying bare the bias accompanying forms of technology that feign objectivity."[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-292)

Big data, deep learning, AGI (2005–2017)
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=45 "Edit section: Big data, deep learning, AGI (2005–2017)")]

In the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as "[big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data "Big data")"), [cheaper and faster computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law") and advanced [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. A turning point was the success of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning "Deep learning") around 2012, which improved the performance of machine learning on many tasks, including image and video processing, text analysis, and speech recognition.[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELeCunBengioHinton2015-293) Investment in AI increased along with its capabilities, and by 2016, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than $8 billion, and the _New York Times_ reported that interest in AI had reached a "frenzy".[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELohr2016-294)

In 2002, [Ben Goertzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel "Ben Goertzel") and others became concerned that AI had largely abandoned its original goal of producing versatile, fully intelligent machines, and argued in favor of more direct research into [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence") (AGI). By the mid-2010s, several companies and institutions had been founded to pursue artificial general intelligence, such as [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI") and [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google")'s [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind "DeepMind"). During the same period, new insights into [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence "Superintelligence") raised concerns that AI was an [existential threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence "Existential risk from artificial general intelligence"). The risks and unintended consequences of AI technology became an area of serious academic research after 2016.

### Big data and big machines

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Big data and big machines")]

The success of machine learning in the 2000s depended on the availability of vast amounts of training data and faster computers.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126%E2%80%9327-295) Russell and Norvig wrote that the "improvement in performance obtained by increasing the size of the data set by two or three orders of magnitude outweighs any improvement that can be made by tweaking the algorithm."[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126-228)[Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton "Geoffrey Hinton") recalled that back in the 80s and 90s, the problem was that "our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow."[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-296) This was no longer true by 2010.

The most useful data in the 2000s came from curated, labeled data sets created specifically for machine learning and AI. In 2007, a group at [UMass Amherst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst "University of Massachusetts Amherst") released "Labeled Faces in the Wild", an annotated set of images of faces that was widely used to train and test [face recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_recognition "Face recognition") systems for the next several decades.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202031-297)[Fei-Fei Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li "Fei-Fei Li") developed [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet "ImageNet"), a database of three million images captioned by volunteers using the [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk "Amazon Mechanical Turk"). Released in 2009, it was a useful body of training data and a benchmark for testing for the next generation of image processing systems.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202022%E2%80%9323-298)[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126-228) Google released [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec "Word2vec") in 2013 as an open source resource. It used large amounts of data text scraped from the internet and [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding "Word embedding") to create a numeric vector to represent each word. Users were surprised at how well it was able to capture word meanings, for example, ordinary vector addition would give equivalences like China + River = Yangtze or London − England + France = Paris.[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian20206-299) This database in particular would be essential for the development of [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model "Large language model") in the late 2010s.

The explosive growth of the internet gave machine learning programs access to billions of pages of text and images that could be [scraped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping "Data scraping"). And, for specific problems, large privately held databases contained the relevant data. [McKinsey Global Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_Global_Institute "McKinsey Global Institute") reported that "by 2009, nearly all sectors in the US economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data".[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcKinsey_&_Co2011-300) This collection of information was known in the 2000s as _[big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big\_data "Big data")_.

In a _[Jeopardy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy! "Jeopardy!")_ exhibition match in February 2011, [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM")'s [question answering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering_system "Question answering system")[Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Watson "IBM Watson") defeated the two best _Jeopardy!_ champions, [Brad Rutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Rutter "Brad Rutter") and [Ken Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings "Ken Jennings"), by a significant margin.[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarkoff2011-301) Watson's expertise would have been impossible without the information available on the internet.[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126-228)

In 2012, [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet "AlexNet"), a [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning "Deep learning") model,[[am]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-303) developed by [Alex Krizhevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Krizhevsky "Alex Krizhevsky"), won the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge"), with significantly fewer errors than the second-place winner.[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202024-304)[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126-228) Krizhevsky worked with [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton "Geoffrey Hinton") at the [University of Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto "University of Toronto").[[an]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-305) This was a turning point in machine learning: over the next few years, dozens of other approaches to image recognition were abandoned in favor of deep learning.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126%E2%80%9327-295)

Deep learning uses a multi-layer [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron "Perceptron"). Although this architecture has been known since the 60s, getting it to work requires powerful hardware and large amounts of training data.[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202127-306) Before these became available, improving the performance of image processing systems required hand-crafted _ad hoc_ features that were difficult to implement.[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202127-306) Deep learning was simpler and more general.[[ao]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-307)

Deep learning was applied to dozens of problems over the next few years (such as speech recognition, machine translation, medical diagnosis, and game playing). In every case, it showed enormous gains in performance.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126%E2%80%9327-295) Investment and interest in AI boomed as a result.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202126%E2%80%9327-295)

### The alignment problem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: The alignment problem")]

It became fashionable in the 2000s to begin talking about the future of AI again and several popular books considered the possibility of [superintelligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligent "Superintelligent") machines and what they might mean for human society. Some of this was optimistic (such as [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil "Ray Kurzweil")'s _[The Singularity is Near](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Singularity\_is\_Near "The Singularity is Near")_), but others warned that a sufficiently powerful AI was [existential threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_of_artificial_general_intelligence "Existential risk of artificial general intelligence") to humanity, such as [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom "Nick Bostrom") and [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky "Eliezer Yudkowsky").[[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202133,_1004-308) The topic became widely covered in the press and many leading intellectuals and politicians commented on the issue.

AI programs in the 21st century are defined by their [goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_function "Utility function")—the specific measures that they are designed to optimize. [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom "Nick Bostrom")'s influential 2014 book _[Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence\_(book) "Superintelligence (book)")_[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-309) argued that, if one isn't careful about defining these goals, the machine may cause harm to humanity in the process of achieving a goal. [Stuart J. Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell "Stuart J. Russell") used the example of an intelligent robot that kills its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead".[[269]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussell2020-310) (This problem is known by the technical term "[instrumental convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence "Instrumental convergence")".) The solution is to _align_ the machine's goal function with the goals of its owner and humanity in general. Thus, the problem of mitigating the risks and unintended consequences of AI became known as "the value alignment problem" or AI alignment.[[270]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig20215,_33,_1002%E2%80%931003-311)

At the same time, machine learning systems had begun to have disturbing unintended consequences. [Cathy O'Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Neil "Cathy O'Neil") explained how statistical algorithms had been among the causes of the [2008 economic crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_recession "Great recession"),[[271]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Neill2016-312)[Julia Angwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Angwin "Julia Angwin") of [ProPublica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPublica "ProPublica") argued that the [COMPAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software) "COMPAS (software)") system used by the criminal justice system exhibited racial bias under some measures,[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202060%E2%80%9361-313)[[ap]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-315) others showed that many machine learning systems exhibited some form of racial [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias "Algorithmic bias"),[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian20206%E2%80%937,_25-316) and there were many other examples of dangerous outcomes that had resulted from machine learning systems.[[aq]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-317)

In 2016, the election of [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") and the controversy over the COMPAS system illuminated several problems with the current technological infrastructure, including misinformation, social media algorithms designed to maximize engagement, the misuse of personal data and the trustworthiness of predictive models.[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202067-318) Issues of [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) "Fairness (machine learning)") and unintended consequences became significantly more popular at AI conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers refocused their careers on these issues. The [value alignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment "AI alignment") became a serious field of academic study.[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202067,_73,_117-319)[[ar]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-321)

### Artificial general intelligence research

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: Artificial general intelligence research")]

In the early 2000s, several researchers became concerned that mainstream AI was too focused on "measurable performance in specific applications"[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202132-322) (known as "[narrow AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_AI "Narrow AI")") and had abandoned AI's original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. An early critic was [Nils Nilsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_John_Nilsson "Nils John Nilsson") in 1995, and similar opinions were published by AI elder statesmen John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Patrick Winston in 2007–2009. Minsky organized a symposium on "human-level AI" in 2004.[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202132-322)[Ben Goertzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel "Ben Goertzel") adopted the term "[artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence")" for the new sub-field, founding a journal and holding conferences beginning in 2008.[[279]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202133-323) The new field grew rapidly, buoyed by the continuing success of artificial neural networks and the hope that it was the key to AGI.

Several competing companies, laboratories and foundations were founded to develop AGI in the 2010s. [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind "DeepMind") was founded in 2010 by three English scientists, [Demis Hassabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis "Demis Hassabis"), [Shane Legg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Legg "Shane Legg") and [Mustafa Suleyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Suleyman "Mustafa Suleyman"), with funding from [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel "Peter Thiel") and later [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk "Elon Musk"). The founders and financiers were deeply concerned about [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety "AI safety") and the [existential risk of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_of_AI "Existential risk of AI"). DeepMind's founders had a personal connection with Yudkowsky, and Musk was among those who were actively raising the alarm.[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMetzWeiseGrantIsaac2023-324) Hassabis was both worried about the dangers of AGI and optimistic about its power; he hoped they could "solve AI, then solve everything else."[[281]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202131-325)_The New York Times_ wrote in 2023, "At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth."[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMetzWeiseGrantIsaac2023-324)

In 2012, [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton "Geoffrey Hinton") (who had been leading neural network research since the 80s) was approached by [Baidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu "Baidu"), which wanted to hire him and all his students for an enormous sum. Hinton decided to hold an auction and, at a Lake Tahoe AI conference, they sold themselves to [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") for a price of $44 million. Hassabis took notice and sold DeepMind to Google in 2014, on the condition that it would not accept military contracts and would be overseen by an ethics board.[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMetzWeiseGrantIsaac2023-324)

[Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman "Sam Altman"), the co-founder and CEO of [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI")

[Larry Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page "Larry Page") of Google, unlike Musk and Hassabis, was an optimist about the future of AI. Musk and Page became embroiled in an argument about the risk of AGI at Musk's 2015 birthday party. They had been friends for decades, but stopped speaking to each other shortly afterwards. Musk attended the only meeting of DeepMind's ethics board, where it became clear that Google was uninterested in mitigating the harm of AGI. Frustrated by his lack of influence, he founded [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI") in 2015, enlisting [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman "Sam Altman") to run it and hiring top scientists. OpenAI began as a non-profit, "free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations."[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMetzWeiseGrantIsaac2023-324) Musk became frustrated again and left the company in 2018. OpenAI turned to Microsoft for continued financial support and Altman and OpenAI formed a for-profit version of the company with more than $1 billion in financing.[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMetzWeiseGrantIsaac2023-324)

In 2021, [Dario Amodei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Amodei "Dario Amodei") and 14 other scientists left OpenAI over concerns that the company was putting profits above safety. They formed [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic "Anthropic"), which soon had $6 billion in financing from Microsoft and Google.[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMetzWeiseGrantIsaac2023-324)

Large language models, AI boom (2017–present)
---------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=50 "Edit section: Large language models, AI boom (2017–present)")]

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2024_AI_patents_by_country_-_artificial_intelligence.svg)

In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide.[[282]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-RandDworld_20241103-326) Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China.[[282]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-RandDworld_20241103-326)

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:20250202_%22AI%22_(search_term)_on_Google_Trends.svg)

The number of Google searches for the term "AI" accelerated in 2022.

The AI boom started with the initial development of key architectures and algorithms such as the [transformer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_architecture "Transformer architecture") in 2017, leading to the scaling and development of large language models exhibiting human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity. The new AI era began in 2020, with the public release of a scaled [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model "Large language model") (LLM) GPT-3, the predecessor of [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT "ChatGPT").[[283]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-327)

### Transformer architecture and large language models

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=51 "Edit section: Transformer architecture and large language models")]

In 2017, the [transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model) "Transformer (machine learning model)") architecture was proposed by Google researchers in a paper titled "[Attention Is All You Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need "Attention Is All You Need")". It exploits a [self-attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)#Self-attention "Attention (machine learning)") mechanism and became widely used in large language models.[[284]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMurgia2023-328) Large language models, based on the transformer, were further developed by other companies: [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI") released [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3 "GPT-3") in 2020, then [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind "DeepMind") released [Gato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gato_(DeepMind) "Gato (DeepMind)") in 2022. These are [foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models "Foundation models"): they are trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. These models can discuss a huge number of topics and display general knowledge, which has raised questions around whether or not they are examples of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence").

[Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates "Bill Gates") was skeptical of the new technology and the hype that surrounded AGI. However, Altman presented him with a live demo of [ChatGPT-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4 "GPT-4") passing an advanced biology test. Gates was convinced.[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMetzWeiseGrantIsaac2023-324) In 2023, [Microsoft Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Research "Microsoft Research") tested the model with a large variety of tasks, and concluded that "it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence") (AGI) system".[[285]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBubeckChandrasekaranEldanGehrke2023-329)

In 2024, [OpenAI o3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o3 "OpenAI o3"), a type of advanced [reasoning model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning_language_model "Reasoning language model") developed by OpenAI, was announced. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark developed by [François Chollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Chollet "François Chollet") in 2019, the model achieved an unofficial score of 87.5% on the semi-private test, surpassing the typical human score of 84%. The benchmark is supposed to be a necessary, but not sufficient, test for AGI. Speaking of the benchmark, Chollet has said, "You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible."[[286]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-330)

Investment in AI grew exponentially after 2020, with venture capital funding for generative AI companies increasing dramatically. Total AI investments rose from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021, with generative AI accounting for approximately 30% of investments by 2023.[[287]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-331) According to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranked the rest of the world in terms of [venture capital funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital_funding "Venture capital funding"), number of [startups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startups "Startups"), and AI [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patents "Patents") granted.[[288]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:02-332) The commercial AI scene became dominated by American [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech "Big Tech") companies, whose investments in this area surpassed those from U.S.-based [venture capitalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capitalists "Venture capitalists").[[289]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-333)[OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI")'s valuation reached $86 billion by early 2024,[[290]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-334) while [NVIDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA "NVIDIA")'s market capitalization surpassed $3.3 trillion by mid-2024, making it the world's largest company by [market capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization "Market capitalization") as the demand for AI-capable [GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU "GPU") surged.[[291]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-335)

### Advent of AI for public use

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=53 "Edit section: Advent of AI for public use")]

[15.ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15.ai "15.ai"), launched in March 2020[[292]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-336) by an anonymous [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT") researcher,[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-337)[[294]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-338) was one of the earliest examples of [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI "Generative AI") gaining widespread public attention during the initial stages of the AI boom.[[295]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-339) The free [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application") demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using neural networks with minimal training data, requiring as little as 15 seconds of audio to reproduce a voice—a capability later corroborated by [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI") in 2024.[[296]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-340) The service went [viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon "Viral phenomenon") on social media platforms in early 2021,[[297]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-341)[[298]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-342) allowing users to generate speech for characters from [popular media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_media "Popular media") franchises, and became particularly notable for its pioneering role in popularizing [AI voice synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_speech_synthesis "Deep learning speech synthesis") for [creative content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation "Content creation") and [memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme "Internet meme").[[299]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-343)

> Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. **Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.** This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system's potential effects. OpenAI's recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence states that "At some point, it may be important to get an independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models." We agree. That point is now.
> 
> 
> Therefore, **we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4**. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.

[ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT "ChatGPT") was launched on 30 November 2022, marking a pivotal moment in artificial intelligence's public adoption. Within days of its release it went viral, gaining over 100 million users in two months and becoming the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.[[301]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:8-345) The chatbot's ability to engage in human-like conversations, write code, and generate creative content captured public imagination and led to rapid adoption across various sectors including [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_in_education "AI in education"), [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_industry "Artificial intelligence in industry"), and research.[[302]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-346) ChatGPT's success prompted unprecedented responses from major technology companies—[Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") declared a "code red" and rapidly launched [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Gemini "Google Gemini") (formerly known as Google Bard), while [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") incorporated the technology into [Bing Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Chat "Bing Chat").[[303]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-347)

The rapid adoption of these AI technologies sparked intense debate about their implications. Notable AI researchers and industry leaders voiced both optimism and concern about the accelerating pace of development. In March 2023, over 20,000 signatories, including [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist")[Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio "Yoshua Bengio"), [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk "Elon Musk"), and [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") co-founder [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak "Steve Wozniak"), signed [an open letter calling for a pause in advanced AI development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pause_Giant_AI_Experiments:_An_Open_Letter "Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter"), citing "[profound risks to society and humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence "Existential risk from artificial intelligence")."[[304]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-348) However, other prominent researchers like [Juergen Schmidhuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juergen_Schmidhuber "Juergen Schmidhuber") took a more optimistic view, emphasizing that the majority of AI research aims to make "human lives longer and healthier and easier."[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-guardian2023-349)

By mid-2024, however, the financial sector began to scrutinize AI companies more closely, particularly questioning their capacity to produce a [return on investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment "Return on investment") commensurate with their massive valuations. Some prominent investors raised concerns about market expectations becoming disconnected from fundamental business realities. [Jeremy Grantham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Grantham "Jeremy Grantham"), co-founder of [GMO LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMO_LLC "GMO LLC"), warned investors to "be quite careful" and drew parallels to previous technology-driven market bubbles.[[306]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-350) Similarly, [Jeffrey Gundlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Gundlach "Jeffrey Gundlach"), CEO of [DoubleLine Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoubleLine_Capital "DoubleLine Capital"), explicitly compared the AI boom to the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble "Dot-com bubble") of the late 1990s, suggesting that investor enthusiasm might be outpacing realistic near-term capabilities and revenue potential.[[307]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-351) These concerns were amplified by the substantial market capitalizations of AI-focused companies, many of which had yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability models.

In March 2024, [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic "Anthropic") released the [Claude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(AI) "Claude (AI)") 3 family of large language models, including Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus.[[308]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-352) The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks, with Claude 3 Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google.[[309]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-353) In June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, particularly in areas such as coding, multistep workflows, and image analysis.[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-354)

In 2024, the [Royal Swedish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy "Royal Swedish Academy") of Sciences awarded [Nobel Prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prizes "Nobel Prizes") in recognition of groundbreaking contributions to [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"). The recipients included:

### Further study and development of AI

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=55 "Edit section: Further study and development of AI")]

In January 2025, OpenAI announced a new AI, ChatGPT-Gov, which would be specifically designed for US government agencies to use securely.[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-chatgpt-gov-356) Open AI said that agencies could utilize ChatGPT Gov on a Microsoft Azure cloud or Azure Government cloud, "on top of Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service." OpenAI's announcement stated that "Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, [FedRAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedRAMP "FedRAMP") High). Additionally, we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data."[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-chatgpt-gov-356)

Countries have invested in policies and funding to deploy [autonomous robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot "Autonomous robot") in an attempt to address labor shortages and enhance efficiency, while also implementing [regulatory frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_artificial_intelligence "Regulation of artificial intelligence") for ethical and safe development.

In 2025, China invested approximately 730 billion yuan (roughly US$100 billion) to advance AI and robotics in smart manufacturing and healthcare.[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-357) The "14th Five-Year Plan" (2021–2025) prioritized service robots, with AI systems enabling robots to perform complex tasks like assisting in surgeries or automating factory assembly lines.[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-358) Some funding also supported defense applications, such as autonomous drones.[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-359)[[316]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-360) Starting in September 2025, China mandated labeling of AI-generated content to ensure transparency and public trust in these technologies.[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-361)

In January 2025, [Stargate LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC "Stargate LLC") was formed as a joint venture of [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI "OpenAI"), [SoftBank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group "SoftBank Group"), [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation "Oracle Corporation"), and [MGX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGX_Fund_Management_Limited "MGX Fund Management Limited"), who announced plans to invest US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") by 2029. The venture was formally announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on 21 January 2025, with SoftBank CEO [Masayoshi Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Son "Masayoshi Son") appointed as chairman.[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-reuters-362)[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-363)

The U.S. government allocated approximately $2 billion to integrate AI and robotics in manufacturing and logistics.[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-364)[_[non-primary source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No\_original\_research#Primary,\_secondary\_and\_tertiary\_sources "Wikipedia:No original research")_] State governments supplemented this with funding for service robots, such as those deployed in warehouses to fulfill verbal commands for inventory management or in eldercare facilities to respond to residents' requests for assistance.[[321]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-365) Some funds were directed to defense, including [lethal autonomous weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon "Lethal autonomous weapon") and [military robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_robot "Military robot"). In January 2025, Executive Order 14179 established an "AI Action Plan" to accelerate innovation and deployment of these technologies with the declared intent of "world domination" and "victory".[[322]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-366)[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-TrumpAI-367)
